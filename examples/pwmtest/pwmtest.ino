/*************************************************** 
  This is an example for our Adafruit 16-channel PWM & Servo driver
  PWM test - this will drive 16 PWMs in a 'wave'

  Pick one up today in the adafruit shop!
  ------> http://www.adafruit.com/products/815

  These drivers use I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to  
  interface.
